                          A Limbus Company bot that charges through MD6 for you
```

---

<img align="left" src="ImageAssets/readme/preview.png" width="55%">

  - ### ⚡ Speed
  A **Normal MD6** run lasts between **23-25 minutes**.
  And it takes **35-45 minutes** for one **Hard MD** run with a Rupture team.

  - ### Starts from any moment of MD exploration

  - ### Restarts if run fails
  If 6 or more sinners are dead, the bot (with default settings) will restart the run.

  - ### Reclicks if action failed
    Sometimes timings mess up, so in order to address this issue most bot actions are verified.

  - ### Supports Luxcavation grind

<br clear="left" />

# Functionality:

- ## Auto-selects the team
  ### *This means that you need to set up the correct team names in advance.*
  - Supported team keywords: <br>
  **SLASH, PIERCE, BLUNT, BURN, BLEED, TREMOR, RUPTURE, SINKING, POISE, CHARGE**
  - Any two-word combination of these keywords (without #number) is also supported
  - For single-word team names, #number is supported
  - The bot scrolls through teams until it finds the uppermost matching team
  - Uses default team if it fails to find the right team
  ### Supported name examples:

  <img src="ImageAssets/readme/team_names.png" width="100%">

- ## Rotates teams
  - *Orange* - currently displayed team
  - *Blue* - other teams included in the rotation
  - The rotation starts from the curretly displayed team and moves from left to right<br><br>

  <img src="ImageAssets/readme/rotation.png" width="100%">

- ## Supports all team builds
  - **Normal MD:** Rupture is the fastest team with average time of 24 minutes per run.  
  - **Hard MD:** Rupture is the best team with average time of 38 minutes per run. <br><br>

  <img src="ImageAssets/readme/team.png" alt="Team" width="100%">

- ## Selects Floor Packs
  <img align="left" src="ImageAssets/readme/config.png" width="55%">

    ### By default:
    - Avoids packs with high mortality rate and long fights such as:  
      **The Noon of Violet, Murder on the WARP Express, Full-Stopped by a Bullet, Timekilling Time, Nocturnal Sweeping** and some other.
    - Prioritizes floors with unique ego gifts such as:  
      **The Outcast, Hell's Chicken** and some other.
    <br>

    ### You can set your own pack priority in config!
    - ***Important note: Prioritized packs are specific to each team type, but Avoided packs apply globally to all teams.***
    - ***There are two different configs for Normal MD and Hard MD***

  <br clear="left" />

- ## Selects the best next node
  ### Bot can detect:

  <img align="center" src="ImageAssets/readme/nodes.png" />

  ### Time cost of each node: <p>
  - **Event: 0s, Normal: 52s, Miniboss: 67s, Focused: 77s, Risky: 87s**

  ### The bot analyzes all visible nodes and builds the fastest path:

  <img align="center" src="ImageAssets/readme/paths.png" />

- ## Handles battles
  ### Normal MD:
  - Winrates focused encounters.
  - Chains skills 1 and 2 for human encounters. 
  - Skill 3 animations take more time than necessary so it is best to avoid it.
  - Doesn't use any EGO, because it is a huge time waste.<br><br>

  <img src="ImageAssets/readme/skills.gif"  width='100%' />

  ### Hard MD:
  - **All battles** are winrated.
  - If the clash is **Struggling** or **Hopeless**, the bot uses the leftmost available EGO.
  - If the clash is **Struggling/Hopeless** and an EGO is selected, it will be replaced with a defense skill.<br><br>
  
  <img src="ImageAssets/readme/ego.gif" width='100%' />

- ## Fuses EGO gifts

  <img align="left" src="ImageAssets/readme/gifts.png" width="49%">

  ### Makes a good team affinity build in shop
    - Fuses gifts to get powerful Tier 4s.
    - Upties and buys affinity-related gifts.
    - If not all gifts are visible, it can **scroll through inventory** while fusing.
    <br><br>

    **If no tier 4 in inventory:**
    - The bot aggressively fuses the **first Tier 4 gift**, even using same-affinity gifts if needed.
    <br><br>

    **Once the first build-related Tier 4 gift is obtained:**
    - Same-affinity gifts will **no longer be used for fusing**.
    <br><br>

    **Once the affinity build is complete:**
    - The bot will browse the shop for **same-affinity gifts** and buy them when found.

# User warning!

This tool does not modify or access any game files and relies solely on the displayed information. <br> There have been no precedents of bans due to using this or similar tools, but I advise against excessive usage for longer than what is humanly possible. <br> I also advise against sharing your in-game ID along with the fact that you use this tool. |

# Installation
### 📦 Option 1: Run the Prebuilt Executable 
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/app.exe-Download-blue.svg)](https://github.com/AlexWalp/Mirror-Dungeon-Bot/releases/latest/download/app.exe) <p>
- Launch **app.exe** from the latest release - no additional files required.
- No OCR is used anymore, all detection is now done with open cv.

### 🐍 Option 2: Run with Python
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed. Then either:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

or manually install:
- `opencv-python-headless`
- `numpy`
- `PyQt6`

Then you can run `App.py` for GUI interface or run `Bot.py` for cmd input without GUI.

# Usage:

> **Game interface must be in English!** <br> **Make sure that the Limbus Company window is fully visible!** <br> Set the in-game resolution to **16:9** ratio (**1920x1080** is best, but **1280x720** also works)


- You can set up sinners and other settings upon program execution. ChargeGrinder will start running in 10 seconds after that. 
- In the meantime you should switch to the Limbus Company window. It is not recommended to move the mouse while the bot is running, but you can Alt+Tab to another window and the bot will pause.

# Recommended Graphics Settings:

<img align="left" src="ImageAssets/readme/fullscreen.png" width="62%">
<h3>1920x1080</h3>

- Provides the best detection result
- If your screen is Full HD or lower with a 16:9 aspect ratio, use Fullscreen at your screen's native resolution
- If your screen resolution is higher than Full HD, use Windowed instead

<br clear="left" />

<img align="left" src="ImageAssets/readme/windowed.png" width="62%">
<h3>1280x720</h3>

- The resolution I usually test new versions with (and mostly use)
- Use windowed mode only
